            <p id="why">
                I choose Northwest Missouri State University because it offers a program called Applied Computer Science at a reasonable price. Currently, Northwest has about 6,800 students; with a student-to-faculty ratio of 22-to-1. The size of campus offers great opportunities for students to succeed academically and socially. Northwest offers more than 127 undergraduate majors and 73 minors.
